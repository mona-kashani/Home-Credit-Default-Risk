# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

This is a data set from kaggle:(https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) and there is a brief explanation of the project that I am going to solve.

Due to weak or non-existent credit records, many people have difficulty obtaining loans. Unfortunately, untrustworthy lenders frequently take advantage of this group.
To ensure that this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit offers a variety of alternative data, including telco and transactional information, to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, I want to challenge myself and predict them in order to maximize the data's potential. This ensures that clients who are capable of repayment are not turned down and that loans are issued with a principal, maturity, and repayment schedule that will enable their clients to succeed.
